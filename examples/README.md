# Examples

flaim models integrate well with existing Flax codebases such as [Google's Big Vision repository](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision) or [Scenic](https://github.com/google-research/scenic). The notebooks in this folder are not intended as full-fledged scripts or alternatives to the aforementioned codebases; rather, they are elementary sample usages of flaim for various vision tasks that gently walk the reader through a particular application without much regard for extendibility, tests, etc.

They include,

â€¢ [```classification-basic.ipynb```](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1U02GNjWUUmjLt9gTHvxOikYvGdA5qFIz?usp=share_link): The most basic of the tutorials, this is ideal for those who would like to dip a toe into flaim without troubling themselves about more advanced topics such as distributed training or complex data pipelines with ```tf.data```.

_More notebooks will be released in the near future._

	Convolution followed by batch normalization and an activation function.

	Args:
		out_dim (T.Optional[int]): Number of output channels.
		If None, it is set to the number of input channels.
		Default is None.
		kernel_size (T.Union[T.Tuple[int, int], int]): Kernel size.
		If an int, this value is used along both spatial dimensions.
		stride (T.Union[T.Tuple[int, int], int]): Stride. If an int,
		this value is used along both spatial dimensions.
		Default is 1.
		padding (T.Optional[T.Union[str, int]]): Padding. If None,
		it is set so the spatial dimensions are exactly divided by stride.
		If an int, this value is used along both spatial dimensions.
		Default is None.
		groups (T.Union[int, str]): Number of groups. If 'dw', a depthwise convolution is performed.
		Default is 1.
		dilation (int): Dilation.
		Default is 1.
		bias (bool): Whether the convolution should have a bias term if bn is False.
		Default is True.
		bias_force (bool): Whether to force the convolution to have a bias term 
		even if bn is True.
		Default is False.
		bn (bool): Whether to have batch normalization after the convolution.
		If False, the training argument is ignored.
		Default is True.
		act (T.Callable): Activation function.
		Default is identity.
		tf (bool): Whether padding and batch_norm_eps should be fixed at 'same'
		and 1e-3 to conform to TensorFlow's settings.
		Default is False.
